# FeaUI

A lightweight, accessible React component library built on top of [Base UI](https://base-ui.com/).

## Important Notice

FeaUI is currently in alpha. Breaking changes may occur before the stable release. Use at your own risk.

### Philosophy

> **Styles belong to styles. Logic belongs to components.**

This principle defines how Fea UI is designed and how it should be used.

FeaUI provides unstyled, accessible, and highly customizable components. It separates logic from styles, allowing developers to apply their own styling solutions without being constrained by predefined styles.
This approach ensures that FeaUI components can seamlessly integrate into any design system or styling framework, providing maximum flexibility and control over the visual presentation of the components.

### Packages

- `@adn-ui/react`: The core React component library.
- `@adn-ui/styles`: A collection of utility-first CSS styles to quickly style FeaUI components.
