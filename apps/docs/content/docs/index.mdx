---

FeaUI is a lightweight, accessible React component library built on top of
[Base UI](https://base-ui.com/). It provides a set of unstyled, accessible
components that you can customize to fit your design system.

> **Styles belong to styles. Logic belongs to components.**

This principle defines how FeaUI is designed and how it should be used. We
believe that component logic (state, accessibility, keyboard interactions)
should be separated from visual styling.

## Why FeaUI?

### Accessible by Default

FeaUI leverages **Base UI**, which is rigorously tested across screen readers
and browsers to ensure robust accessibility (WAI-ARIA compliant). You get
complex interactive components like Dialogs, Tabs, and Selects that just work.

### Fully Customizable

FeaUI components ship with **no default styles**. You have complete control over
the look and feel using standard CSS or Tailwind CSS. We provide a default theme
to get you started, but you aren't fighting against a library's specific
CSS-in-JS solution or opinionated design tokens.

### Type Safe

Built with TypeScript, FeaUI provides a first-class developer experience with
autocomplete and type safety out of the box.

## Bem Methodology

FeaUI uses the [BEM](https://getbem.com) (Block Element Modifier) methodology to
structure its CSS classes. This methodology provides a clear and consistent way
to name and organize CSS classes, making it easier to understand and maintain
the code.

## Status

> [!WARNING] FeaUI is currently in **alpha**. Breaking changes may occur before
> the stable release. Use at your own risk.

## Community
